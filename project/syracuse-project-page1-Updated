<h3> About Syracuse Uprise </h3>
<p> We are a non-profit organization dedicated to bringing awarness to the institutional poverty issues in Syracuse, New York. For decades, Syracuse has struggled with history of violence in regards to drugs, gangs, and much more. But we are dedicated to putting a stop to this! We are actively working to encourage citizens of our city to give back to those who are in dire need of basic resources, such as food, water and shelter. We are also actively working with the children in the community to ensure that we are guiding them toward the right direction; this is done through education on important issues, as well as recreational and stress relief based activities. We also work to keep our citizens up to date on important news and information. Through this site, we will educate the public on how we can come together as a community to help others. </p>
